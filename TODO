# from future, import...
# rgf script returns non-zero exit status if any specs failed
# --> At this point we can be used by a CI bot :-)
# ExampleGroups can be properly nested
# before-functions are properly dealt with in nested contexts
# Actually work out the language issues
# ProgressFormatter can output coloured dots if asked
# DocumentationFormatter can output something like Rspec's specdoc format
# formatter can be chosen by passing an arg to rgf
# config can be extracted to a .rgf project file
# --> At this point we're probably useful
